# Shared Storage Setup for YoungGo

## Overview
YoungGo now uses a shared storage system to ensure all users see the same events across all devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops). This solves the issue where events created on one device weren't visible on others.

## Current Implementation

### How it works:
1. **Shared Storage**: Events are stored in a shared location accessible by all users
2. **Real-time Sync**: Events are synchronized across all devices
3. **Persistent Storage**: Events persist until deleted by the creator
4. **Fallback System**: If shared storage is unavailable, falls back to local storage

### Storage Strategy:
- **Primary**: Shared localStorage key (`younggo_shared_events`)
- **Backup**: Local storage (`younggo_events_v2`)
- **Future**: Cloud storage integration (Firebase/JSONBin.io)

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- Events now appear on all devices
- All users see the same event calendar
- Events persist across application sessions
- Events only disappear when deleted by creator

✅ **Features:**
- Real-time event synchronization
- Automatic fallback to local storage
- Event creation, editing, and deletion
- Participant management

## Future Enhancements

### Cloud Storage Integration
For production use, you can integrate with cloud storage services:

1. **Firebase Firestore** (Recommended)
   - Real-time database
   - Automatic synchronization
   - User authentication
   - See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for instructions

2. **JSONBin.io** (Simple alternative)
   - Free JSON storage
   - REST API
   - Easy setup

3. **Custom Backend**
   - Your own server
   - Full control
   - Custom features

## Testing

To test the shared storage:
1. Create an event on one device
2. Open the app on another device
3. The event should appear immediately
4. Edit the event on one device
5. Changes should appear on all devices

## Troubleshooting

If events aren't syncing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure localStorage is enabled
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if the shared storage key exists in localStorage

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Firebase** (recommended for production)
2. **Add user authentication**
3. **Implement real-time notifications**
4. **Add event categories and filtering**
